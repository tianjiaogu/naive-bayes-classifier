# naive-bayes-classifier
This is a project of Data Mining class

We use three data sets of increasing complexity from UCI repository, and each of the data set has two classes and discrete valued features. 

Balloons (Inflated or Not Inflated)

Diabetes (Positive or Negative)

Breast Cancer (Benign or Malignant)

The goal of this experiment is to demonstrate the performance of this classifier. Performance will be measured by the averages of accuracy scores taken over sets of 10 trials.
